## Installation Methods

### 1. Clustered Containerized Installation (Kubernetes)

Helm deployment with explicit database, protocol, credentials and certificate settings. OC remains single-replica until shared sessions are implemented. Read [the deployment contract](containerized/TRANSPORT_DEPLOYMENT.md) before upgrading; this chart requires matching newly built service images.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/project-openan/openan-installation.git
cd openan-installation/containerized/online-install
bash one_click_install.sh --skip-build --skip-infra --values /path/to/deployment.yaml
```

**Features:**
- Modular component selection (Registry Center, Orchestration Center, Workflow Designer)
- Fully configurable parameters by helm values(LLM API keys, image registry, storage)
- Existing cluster/Helm/Ingress infrastructure managed independently
- HTTP/HTTPS, external MySQL/PostgreSQL, and credential/certificate Secret injection
- One-click uninstall with optional data cleanup

**Manual / System Admin Installation:**
If you prefer to manually install the Helm chart, follow these steps:
- Prerequisites: Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster (v1.25+) and Helm 3.10.0+ installed.
- Build your local images by running `containerized/build/build.sh` or pull from ghcr.io.
- Customize the Helm chart values in `containerized/online-install/openan-chart/values.yaml`, and then install the chart using Helm:
```bash
cd containerized/online-install
helm upgrade --install openan ./openan-chart -n openan --create-namespace -f /path/to/deployment.yaml
```

### 2. One-Click Binary Installation

Historical binary installer for virtual machines/bare metal. It has not been validated against the current authentication/configuration contract; do not treat it as a supported current-service deployment. Use maintained Helm or single-host Compose for current images.

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
cd binary/one-click
./install.sh
```

**Features:**
- Downloads and starts all services locally (PostgreSQL, Registry, Orchestration, Frontend)
- Automatic dependency setup (Python venvs, Node.js)
- Modular component selection (Registry Center, Orchestration Center, Workflow Designer in nginx)
- Historical flow only; current service compatibility is not certified

## Uninstall

### Containerized

```bash
cd containerized/online-install
./uninstall.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
helm uninstall openan -n openan
kubectl delete namespace openan
```

### Binary

```bash
cd binary/one-click
./uninstall.sh
```

The single-host [offline Compose installer](containerized/offline-install-compose/README.md) supports internal/external MySQL or PostgreSQL, independent public/backend HTTP/HTTPS, explicit credentials and readonly PKI/model mounts. It deploys one instance per application, not an HA cluster. The legacy independent offline Kubernetes build/install paths are blocked until they reuse and validate the maintained chart.

## Upgrade

> Container upgrades use the same explicit values file via one_click_install.sh --skip-build --skip-infra (or native helm upgrade --install). Back up data, pin image tags/source refs, and restart Pods when subPath Secrets change. Binary installer compatibility is outside this container remediation.
